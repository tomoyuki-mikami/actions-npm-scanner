# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architecture decision along with its context and consequences.

## Conventions

- Directory: `docs/adr`
- Naming: use date-prefixed files: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- Status values: `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `deprecated`, `superseded`

## Workflow

- Create a new ADR as `accepted` when documenting an already approved implementation decision.
- Use `proposed` when the decision still needs review.
- If replaced later, create a new ADR and mark the old one `superseded`.
